This is a hack of a Python script to download your Runtastic running sessions.

To use:
1. Install Python prerequisites by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a file called *auth* next to this script containing your Runtastic username and password, on two separate lines.
3. Run `python scrape.py /path/to/save/to`
